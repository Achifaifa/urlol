Done for the GE10 Wild Compo.

#### General idea

This demo takes the idea from [@Glench's site](http://glench.com/hash/) and takes it a bit further.

#### Playing:

* The "loading" animation is just an excuse to table flip something. The file is local so it's probably already loaded. Just press play
* All the different frames get stored in your browsing history. PLEASE use private browsing while watching this (Or your browser may or may not explode)

#### Known issues:

* When loading the page for the first time it works just fine, but when pausing/replaying or reloading the page the sound does not work. Working on it.
