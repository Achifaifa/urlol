#### General idea

This demo takes the idea from [@Glench's site](http://glench.com/hash/) a bit further.

#### Playing:

* The "loading" animation is just an excuse to table flip something. The file is local so it's probably already loaded. Just press play
* All the different frames get stored in your browsing history. PLEASE use private browsing while watching this (Or your browser may or may not explode)

#### Known issues:

* When loading the page for the first time it works just fine, but when pausing/replaying or reloading the page the sound may not work. Apparently a wrong HTML formatting fixed the issue but it may not load the sound at times. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
